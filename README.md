## Technical Skills

- Deploying cloud services in Google Cloud, using Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Life Sciences, Batch, Vertex AI Workbench, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and BigQuery
- Scripting in R and Bash in IDE and notebook environments; basic familiarity with Python, SQL, and YAML
- Version control and project management with git, GitHub, and Cloud Source Repositories
- Deploying open-source, containerized, and reproducible bioinformatics tools and pipelines for: genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, data mining, data processing, and statistical analysis

## Professional Experience

### The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)

Manassas, Virginia  
Bioinformatician  
May 2018 - November 2020  

- Created and operated the back-end data management system for the ATCC Genome Portal, and ATCC database of 700+ bacterial, viral, and fungal reference genomes tied to specific authenticated material; using Python, SQL, AWS EC2 instances and AWS S3 buckets to manage data from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms
- Developed all automated data processing pipelines and reports for BEI Resources, ATCC’s key government contract; handled de novo genome assembly, read mapping, and variant calling for DNASeq, RNASeq, metagenomic, and targeted amplicon sequencing datasets
- Managed bioinformatics project goals for the ATCC Genome Portal in collaboration with partner organizations, tracked and ensured project goals were met on deadline, and reviewed data generated by partner bioinformaticians
- Interviewed, hired, and mentored a new bioinformatics internship position, who was subsequently hired as ATCC’s second full time bioinformatician
- Represented and communicated project results to the scientific community via publications, blog posts, presentations, and posters at scientific conferences
