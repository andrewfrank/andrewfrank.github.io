- Coordinated between various university stakeholders to ensure compliance and optimization of SBI’s cloud computing infrastructure and learning content
- Created and curated bioinformatics learning content for users, including bioinformatics tutorials, running virtual seminars, and a new university intranet site linking users to bioinformatics services across the university
- Advised on the creation of cloud infrastructure for the university; authored a demo server-less pipeline for handling sensitive PII-containing data sources using GCP Workflows with the Healthcare and Data Loss Prevention APIs

### The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) — Manassas, Virginia

Bioinformatician  
May 2018 - November 2020  

- Created and operated the back-end data management system for the ATCC Genome Portal, and ATCC database of 700+ bacterial, viral, and fungal reference genomes tied to specific authenticated material; using Python, SQL, AWS EC2 instances and AWS S3 buckets to manage data from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms
- Developed all automated data processing pipelines and reports for BEI Resources, ATCC’s key government contract; handled de novo genome assembly, read mapping, and variant calling for DNASeq, RNASeq, metagenomic, and amplicon sequencing datasets
- Managed bioinformatics project goals for the ATCC Genome Portal in collaboration with partner organizations, tracked and ensured project goals were met on deadline, and reviewed data generated by partner bioinformaticians
- Interviewed, hired, and mentored a new bioinformatics internship position, who was subsequently hired as ATCC’s second full time bioinformatician
- Represented and communicated project results to the scientific community via publications, blog posts, presentations, and posters at scientific conferences
