## Professional Experience

### The Henry M. Jackson Foundation (HJF)

Bethesda, MD  
Bioinformatics Research Associate II  
October 2021 - Present  

### The Informatics Applications Group (TIAG)

Reston, Virginia  
Bioinformatics Scientist  
November 2020 - October 2021  

- Founded and managed the “Student Bioinformatics Initiative” (SBI) at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), a bioinformatics best-practices clearinghouse, cloud computing lab, and consultation center for bioinformatics users at USUHS
- Consulted on graduate student and postdoctoral researcher bioinformatics projects in the cloud, including assistance implementing GCP solutions for bioinformatics pipelines for WGS + RNASeq datasets, downstream statistical analyses, image processing, and querying large-scale healthcare datasets
- Created and curated bioinformatics learning content for users, including bioinformatics tutorials, running virtual seminars, and a new university intranet site linking users to bioinformatics services across the university
- Coordinated between various university bioinformatics stakeholders to ensure compliance and optimization of SBI’s cloud computing infrastructure and learning content
- Advised on the creation of cloud infrastructure for the university; authored a demo server-less pipeline for handling PHI-containing data sources using GCP Workflows with the Healthcare and Data Loss Prevention APIs 

### The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)

Manassas, Virginia  
Bioinformatician  
May 2018 - November 2020  

- Created and operated the back-end data management system for the ATCC Genome Portal, and ATCC database of 700+ bacterial, viral, and fungal reference genomes tied to specific authenticated material; using Python, SQL, AWS EC2 instances and AWS S3 buckets to manage data from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms
- Developed all automated data processing pipelines and reports for BEI Resources, ATCC’s key government contract; handled de novo genome assembly, read mapping, and variant calling for DNASeq, RNASeq, metagenomic, and amplicon sequencing datasets
- Managed bioinformatics project goals for the ATCC Genome Portal in collaboration with partner organizations, tracked and ensured project goals were met on deadline, and reviewed data generated by partner bioinformaticians
- Interviewed, hired, and mentored a new bioinformatics internship position, who was subsequently hired as ATCC’s second full time bioinformatician
- Represented and communicated project results to the scientific community via publications, blog posts, presentations, and posters at scientific conferences
